# alcohol unit counter

Product Vision. 
The product is imagined as a clear and simple means of understanding how much alcohol (in units) 
the consumer has drunk/might drink if they consume the product selected from the website.  
This will allow consumers to decide how many units they want to consume, and give them the ability to make informed decisions 
on their alcohol intake.
